## Paved with Good Intentions

This site is just getting started. What are you expecting to find here? I'm just leaving sort of the default index markdown file here for a while. 

The [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mcamiano/articles/edit/main/docs/index.md) maintains and previews the content for the site in Markdown files.

GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages from the content in Markdown files committed to the main branch.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mcamiano/articles/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
